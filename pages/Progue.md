alias: the strange man

- He is a tall and spindly figure whose age has been clouded by castaway years to become unsure and irrelevant, bleached hair and bushy eyebrows lifting a contented face scrubbed clean by sea breeze and sunlight. He wears pants that were once white, and a shirt that was once blue but now falls in grey threadbare tatters and streams from bony arms and scratched elbows, a dancer's costume twirling alike with the breeze and his jittery movements. These seem focused in his large, rough hands, as if they house some sleeping power that swells joints and sharpens sinews in constant, futile struggle to escape.

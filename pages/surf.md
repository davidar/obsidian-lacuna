- [otherwise if falling uptide]The tide seems to be ebbing out, but the waves are still relatively close.
- [otherwise if falling downtide]The tide is a good distance away, and seems to be ebbing even farther out.
- [otherwise if low tide]The waves are a long way down, breaking languidly against the wet beach.[otherwise if rising downtide]
- The waves are a good distance away, but the tide seems to be flowing back in.
- [otherwise if rising uptide]The surf is relatively close, each wave seeming to crash a little closer.
- The warm water feels fresh and alive as it swirls over your hand.

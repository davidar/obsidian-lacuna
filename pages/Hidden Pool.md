alias:: the hot springs by the waterfall

- Tucked away in a natural bowl stained with sea-blue hues, hidden from view, this beautiful [[pool]] is fed by a clear [[waterfall]] cascading down from an overhang above. Steam rises from the almost perfectly circular pool, which looks deep enough for diving but not so deep that the blue-tinted floor is not visible, and leafy green fronds sway gently on all sides, creating a secluded and relaxing ambiance.
- A rich vein of crumbling [[sea-blue crystal]] runs through the wall behind the [[waterfall]], staining the rock face and water of the pool a brilliant indigo.
- A gap in the trees marks the way west back to the open.

- Wind stirs the greenery fringing the pool, causing it to shimmer and dance as it reflects in the emerald water.
- A [[gull]] circles overhead momentarily, eyeing you warily before moving on.
- Silver-white [light-source] glimmers on the hexagonal facets of [[crystal]] under the [[waterfall]].

title:: Abandoned Cabin

- The small cabin lies well [[up]] above the high water mark, but stains and crusted salt near its base indicate spring tides have reached it in the past, and give the small building the feel of a place abandoned. The cabin rests flush against the black [[lava flow]] behind it.
- Despite its ramshackle appearance, upon closer examination the construction is solid and the cabin seems undamaged.
- [[Sand]] drifts around the open doorway, spilling out in tiny dunes across the wooden floorboards[if Back Room is visited or Studio is visited] disturbed only by your footsteps[otherwise], undisturbed[end if]. Bare, water-stained walls frame a small room, empty and abandoned save for a [[manta ray skeleton]] hanging from one wall; [[some frayed ropes]] tied to one beam are the only other hint of past furnishings.
- The room's sole other feature is [[a wooden box]] discarded in a corner.
- Two smaller interior doorways lead [north] to the [[studio]] or [east] to [[the tiny storage room]]

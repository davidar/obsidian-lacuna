alias:: the tiny storage room

- Only a dim light filters into this windowless back room.
- The back [[lava wall]] seems unnaturally dark, and as your eyes adjust, you realize it is not wood but the smoothed face of the [[lava flow]]
- A wide crack in the smoothed wall is filled in by [[cobblestones]] near the ceiling, and a thick wooden [[door]] below
- Other than the [[door]] east and a pile of smashed wood [[splinters]] in a corner, the only notable feature is the exit [west] back to [[the front room]].
- The exit back [west] to [[the front room]] and the [if lava tunnel door is closed]imposing closed[otherwise]heavy open[end if] [[door]] [east] are the only two exits

alias:: buttons

- Each is a circle about the size of one made with a thumb and finger, flush with the door but very slightly convex. Stylized symbols are inlaid into each one. From left to right, the symbols are [[manta button]], [[tree button]], [[crystal button]], [[berry button]], [[mussel button]], [[snail button]].
- The buttons are flush with the [[door]], the seams so tight you could not even get a fingernail in.
- You smash the base of your hand against it, but it simply pops back out again.
- With a gentle snick, the button depresses into the door, then pops back out as you release it.
- A heavy clunk and wooden grinding sound from behind the [[door]] as it swings open, revealing a [[fissure]] running into the black [[lava rock]]
- You enter the combination into the [[door]]. As you press the final button, it swings open with a heavy clunk and wooden grinding, revealing the narrow [[chasm]] behind it.

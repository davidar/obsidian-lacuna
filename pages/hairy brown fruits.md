alias:: hairy brown fruit, konokuk fruits

- High near the top of the trees, you can see clusters of round brown fruits.
- These round hairy spheres, the fruit of the [[konokuk tree]], are about the size of your head.
- You crack one of the fruits open with little effort, revealing a firm pink-white pulp and some gooey clear liquid inside.
- You heft one of the head-sized fruits in your hands, but decide you can probably do whatever you need to do with it here, rather than carrying it around.
- The pulp is delicious, with a flavour redolent of peppermint and sea salt, and the liquid is warm and nutty.
- Covered in [[coarse, ropy fibres]].
- "Just give the [[konokuk fruits]] a good solid punch and they'll split right open," Progue #says cheerfully. "Delicious delicious."

alias:: the door, the door of the cabin on the beach

- Only just your height but wider than a normal door, its wooden surface has been planed smooth to bring out a complex grain.
- This side of the wide door crawls with a complex mechanism of clockwork [[gears]] and cogs, along with a large horizontal [[lever]] which can be pulled outwards
- It is unpainted except for [[six small bands of vertical colour]] at about eye level.
- At about the height you'd expect to see a doorknob runs a smooth [[arc of small buttons]], each engraved with a stylized symbol
- You rap your knuckles sharply against the door, feeling the firmness of thick wood, but also a faint resonance and echo of space beyond.
- You put your ear close to the door as you experimentally press a few buttons. You can distinctly hear the snick of dowels and gears moving each time, but can't discern any difference between the buttons. But after some experimentation you're quite sure the machinery on the other side is storing the sequence of buttons pressed, and presumably the correct pattern will open the door.
- You can't see any obvious way to open it: no knob or handle, just the row of [[buttons]] and the [[bands of colour]].
- You don't see any sort of keyhole.
- You brace yourself and shove against the door with your shoulder, but it doesn't even creak, let alone budge.
- You take a running start and ram the door with your shoulder, but gain nothing save a bruise. The door is solidly constructed and whatever mechanism holds it fast is sturdily built.
- The door is almost flush with the floor and surrounding masonry; you cannot see beyond it.

All gone as gone now, but each left a secret, oh! green eons ago, and now they're sort of tourist attractions. You get a prize if you find them all! The secrets. Or so the tourist board says. Of course there aren't any tourists here. Real ones I mean, no offenses."

Not one. Think on that a spell, duckling. And a pretty pretty place to lose one's mind. As long as I've lived here, it's been my home." He frowns, then smiles. "That's redundant," he adds happily, "but true."

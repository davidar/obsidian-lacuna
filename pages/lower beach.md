alias:: the shore

- The [[tide]] breaks at your feet, sending warm runners of foam to kiss the wet sand by your feet.
- The sand is smooth and damp, sprinkled with a profusion of shells, small stones, and clumps of seaweed.
- A huge and beautiful [[sculpture of a manta ray]], carved from some [[clear crystal]], sits on a track running into the [[waves]].
- You can hike back up the beach in one of several directions: towards [[the rocky rise]], towards the [[log cabin]], or towards [[the beach near the path]]. You could also wade out into the [[ocean waters]].

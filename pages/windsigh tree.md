alias:: windsigh, windsigh trees

- Like the others you've seen, the tree seems stunted and out of place.
- Spirals of [[vine]] sprout from the gnarled trunk and wrap tightly around it before spreading out to knobby [[branches]] beginning just above your head. The branches bifurcate until they end in tiny, bare pointed twigs. As the vines spiral around them they sprout hundreds of small [[lemon-yellow leaves]]. Even more curious is that dozens of [[holes]] seem to have organically grown through the branches, as if they split and reconnected to themselves as the tree was growing; these also continue all the way out to the tiny twigs, shrinking in size as they go.
- Some part of you shivers at the thought; so defenseless they are, helpless against anything you could do-- but if you do make such a decision, better to wait until the right moment.
- The trees seem fairly sturdy. Without an axe or something you doubt you could do much damage.

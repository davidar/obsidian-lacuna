alias:: the overgrown path, Fork

- Smells of damp earth and a profusion of greenery encircle this half-clearing amidst light forest. Trees encrusted with moss rise from a carpet of grassy, leaf-strewn earth, along with tall stands of bamboo and explosions of delicate fronds.
- The clearing is dominated by [[the strange tree you painted]], vine-wrapped trunk rising from gnarled roots, lemon-yellow leaves springing from sinuous branches. At the base of the tree, a leaf-lined [[nook]] curls invitingly between two gnarled roots.
- Though long overgrown with moss and concealed by huge fallen leaves, a path was once cut through the vegetation, connecting what looks like a [beach](South Beach) through the trees to the northwest with the deeper [[forest]] to the south

alias:: the slopes of the volcano, the outer slope of the volcano

- The trees fail entirely at this spot, giving way to the smooth brown slopes of a tall [[volcano]], fortunately quiet at the moment. A few clusters of [[berry bushes]] ease the transition into more barren terrain above, but the undergrowth twists into an impassable [[thicket]] down slope.
- You could take an easy but long hike up to [[the volcano's rim]] southeast, or return to the [[forest]] to the north.

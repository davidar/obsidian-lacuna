alias:: the cluster of tree stumps

- The [[remains]] of what once must have been a small copse of trees on this bit of grassy land overlook [[the edge of the marsh]] . Across the marsh rises a sheer cliff, rising to the summit of [[the mountain]].
- Jutting from the rock near the short drop-off to the sea is [[a roughly-hewn block]] of grey stone.
- Far across the marsh to the northeast down a soggy slope is the sheer cliff face of the mountain. You could also follow the drier stretch south up the rise or northwest over to the tiny shack at the base of the ropeway.

alias:: konokuk tree

- Some konokuk trees are a backdrop. They are in [[North Beach]] and [[Rise]].
- The knobby brown trunks of the konokuk trees curve gently up to a cluster of leafy fronds and [[hairy brown fruits]] well above your head.
- You grip the leathered trunk of the tree firmly and start shimmying up. It's hard work. Sweat ripples your face and your hands become tender and slippery. But finally you reach the top of the tree, within touching distance of the [[hairy brown fruits]]. You manage to knock a few loose, before returning to the ground and picking bits of bark from your roughened hands tenderly.
- You grip a trunk and vigorously shake the tree back and forth. After a moment a few of the fruits fall; you hastily step aside as they cannonball into the sand near your feet with loud thunks.
- Tall, swaying trees -- what [[Progue]] called 'konokuk' trees, you remember -- rise above you, providing some welcome shade against the tropical sun, their bases strewn with round, [[hairy brown fruits]]

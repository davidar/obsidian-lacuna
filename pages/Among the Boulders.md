alias:: the stand of rounded boulders, the cluster of boulders

- Large mottled boulders rise from the sand here at the end of the beach, rubbed smooth by eons of tides and wind, green lichens clutching their sides. Across the bay, a rocky volcanic rise sticks out into the [[ocean]], forming the lagoon's far boundary; this end is framed by a rocky point beyond the boulders.
- Small green [[mussels]] cling to the lower edges of the boulders

- Sandy paths wander southwest towards [[the rocky point]], while the beach opens up to the northeast towards [[the edge of the forest]].

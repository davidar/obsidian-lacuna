alias:: inside the manta sculpture

- Phosphorescent glows drift through the black lagoon around you as the [[rayfish]] glide effortlessly through the lagoon. #night
- Surrounding you on all sides is a fantastic underwater vista. Brightly coloured [[fish]] twirl and dart among coral reefs and gently waving plants of red and green. Sunlight filters heavily through the [[waves]] and the [[transparent crystal]] of the sculpture; the facets are so expertly carved you hardly notice it's there. #day
- The hatchway above leads [outside], though you probably don't want to use it while you're underwater. A [[large wooden wheel]] on the floor seems to [[interface with the track on the ocean floor]], which ends beneath you.
- if Progue is fulfilling and the animus of Progue is swimming:
  		say "Above you through the crystal, you can see [the Progue], floating languidly on the surface of the water.";
  		move distant-Progue to location;
  	else:
  		fire one off by frequency from Table of Inside-Manta Ambience, definitely selecting, no extra spacing.

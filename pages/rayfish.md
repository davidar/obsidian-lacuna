alias:: manta ray creature

- Your breath catches in your throat as you realize what the lights are: huge, glowing rayfish gliding gracefully above the submerged sand at your feet. Their great broad backs give off a faint but steady phosphorescent glow, stronger at their wingtips.
- The ghostly [rayfish] glide silently through the waters of the lagoon, each longer than you are tall.
- Carefully, you reach down into the water as one of the great glowing creatures swims past. Velvet-smooth skin glides across your hand for a moment; then the creature suddenly darts away, leaving behind a cloud of [[jet-black ink]].
- You move to strike at one of the great glowing creatures, but instantly it jerks away and accelerates out of range, phosphorescence fading, and leaves behind a cloud of [[jet-black ink]] in its wake.

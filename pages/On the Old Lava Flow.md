title:: On the Old Lava Flow

- Here is where the lava met the sea, after cutting a long swath across the island. From your position atop the flow you can see both sides of the island:
	- the land drops off into a marshy swamp that stretches to the edge of [[a jagged mountain]]
	- curves the tranquil white crescent of the [[lagoon]], protected by the [[lava flow]] as it rises to the shattered side of the distant [[volcano]]
- You are surprised to see a [[ropeway]] stretching from a meadow high atop [[the mountain]] to a small base station near the island's northwestern corner
- From here, you could scramble southeast to the [[beach]] or take an easier route north down the other side of the flow towards [[the edge of the marsh]].
- You can also hear the sound of a [[waterfall]] through some heavy fronds east opposite the sea.
- ---
- The [[surf]] [one of]beats heavily against the sharp edges of the flow beneath you[or]smashes into the lava flow, sending wisps of spray up above the edge of the flow[or]crashes into the jutting edge of the lava flow, sending clouds of spray up over the edge to moisten your clothes[as decreasingly likely outcomes].
- A [[gull]] lands by a tiny stream trickling out of the overgrowth and drinks deeply, then begins to clean itself.
- A [[seagull]] swoops past your head, flying into the dense vegetation to the side; a miniature vortex of wind pulls and tugs at the heavy fronds.

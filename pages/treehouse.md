- The treehouse is tall and all organic curves and lumps, not a straight line to be seen. The windows are skinny ovals of differing sizes; the roof slopes up here, extrudes outwards there, and is thatched in each spot with wildly differing material. Despite the obvious work that went into its construction, it now seems overgrown and long abandoned, eerie somehow through the negative presence of absent children.

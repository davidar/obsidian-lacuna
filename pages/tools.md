- Your heart skips a beat as you realize these are mostly the tools of a painter. Clay pots seem to hold paints of varying shades and consistencies (though long since dried, useless now) and hides scraped smooth to make canvases are strewn around the workbench, along with rotting handmade brushes. It will take some time to put everything in order, but it looks like most of the tools you'll need to move on, when the time comes for that, are here
- You can take a full inventory later. At the moment you simply take comfort in the knowledge that you will not be stranded here
- [if wall to wall workbench is dirty]These tools are a suggestion right now more than a possibility. The paints are dried and useless; the brushes rotting and stale, and you see no blank canvas. But their presence indicates that when the time comes, everything necessary must be here on this island... somewhere[otherwise]Progue has prepped this room for your use, but you still lack a complete set of paints, a brush, and, of course, a canvas
